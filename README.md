# Item Catalog

This is the third project in my pursuit of the Full-Stack Web Developer
Nanodegree from Udacity. Following is Udacity's description for this project:

"In this project, you will be developing a web application that provides a list
of items within a variety of categories and integrate third party user
registration and authentication. Authenticated users should have the ability to
post, edit, and delete their own items. You will be creating this project
essentially from scratch, no templates have been provided for you. This means
that you have free reign over the HTML, the CSS, and the files that include the
application itself utilizing Flask."
